# Java Interface
This Java program demonstrates the implementation of an interface and related classes to perform various array operations, including **uniqueness checks**, **finding the largest integers**, and **calculating the greatest sum of consecutive integers**. The application allows users to interact with the program via a simple menu-driven interface.

## Specifications
The program consists of the following components:
1. **Operation Interface:** Defines abstract methods for array operations.
2. **Uniqueness Class:** Verifies whether the elements in the array are unique.
3. **LargestIntegers Class:** Identifies the three largest integers in the array.
4. **GreatestSum Class:** Computes the greatest sum of three consecutive integers.
5. **Starter Class:** Contains the main method for running the program and initiating the menu-based interface.

## Usage
1. In the command line, navigate to your folder and compile the provided Java files using `javac *`.
2. Run the starter class using `java Starter.java`.
3. Input the necessary data as prompted to perform the desired array operations.
